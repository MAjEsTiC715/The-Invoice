"# stock-portfolio-code" 
This is my first time using GitHub and doing OOP for Python.
There is an attribute error that keeps occuring whenever I try to compile it, here it is:
      "Expected Sales Value: " + format(self.expectSale, '.2f') + "\n" + \
      AttributeError: 'CompanyStocks' object has no attribute 'expectSale'

I am currently tring to fix it
